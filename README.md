# QuantLab
# What is it?
QuantLab is a Python library designed to backtest stock market strategies. The library currently uses the yfinance (Yahoo Finance) API as a means for extracting financial data, which is then manipulated utilizing Pandas dataframes and Numpy functions. There are also options to extract the backtested results directly into excel files.
